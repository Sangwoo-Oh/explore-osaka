          <p>Osaka, once known as Naniwa, has been a vital center of Japanese culture and commerce for centuries. During the Edo period, Osaka flourished as a hub of trade and became known as the "Nation's Kitchen" due to its role in rice distribution.<br>The city played a significant role in the unification of Japan under Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the late 16th century. Osaka Castle, originally built in 1583, stands as a symbol of the city's storied past and enduring resilience. Today, Osaka continues to honor its history while embracing innovation and progress.</p>
